Hi, my name is Julian Zilker. I am an engineer and lecturer for the course **Introduction to Git** at the [University of Wuerzburg](https://www.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite/). On my profile you will find repositories with educational purpose, as well as private projects and research results from my studies.

My main interests are **Git**, **Python**, **C/C++** and I am always looking forward to learn more about software engineering. Feel free to contact me anytime on GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julian-zilker/).
